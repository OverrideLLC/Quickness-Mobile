/**
 * Represents a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) within the application's navigation context.
 *
 * A URI is used to identify a specific screen or destination within the app.
 * It can contain information such as the screen's route, parameters, and deep link data.
 *
 * **Purpose:**
 * The `Uri` interface provides a consistent way to represent and interact with
 * navigation destinations in the application. It allows for navigation to be
 * triggered and handled based on URIs, enabling features like deep linking,
 * navigation history, and shared navigation logic.
 *
 * **Key Responsibilities:**
 * - **Encapsulate navigation information:** Represents a destination with its route, parameters, etc.
 * - **Trigger navigation:** Provides a way to navigate to the screen represented by the URI.
 * - **Integration with navigation framework:** Should be compatible with the chosen navigation system (e.g., Jetpack Compose Navigation).

     * Navigates to a new screen or destination.
     *
     * This function encapsulates the logic for navigating to a new screen
     * within the application. It might handle things like pushing a new
     * screen onto a navigation stack, updating a navigation state, or
     * triggering a transition animation.
     *
     * **Implementation Details:**
     * This function should be implemented with the specific navigation
     * framework or approach used in your application. For example, you might
     * use Jetpack Compose Navigation, Android Navigation Component, or
     * a custom navigation solution.
     *
     * **Example Usage:**
     * ```kotlin
     * // Navigates to the profile screen.
     * navigate()
     * ```
